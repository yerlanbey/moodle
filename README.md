## Introduction

Nowadays we have many websites platforms such as Moodle, PMS(portal of SDU), Coursera that help to students in learning processes. Yes they are convenient but they have some disadvantages of their own. We will talk about them later.
And we have a solution. It is developing a LMS platform for students of our university on platform IOS (combination of PMS and Moodle). This project will combine both the PMSs’ and Moodles’ main functions.

## Objective

To develop a LMS platform for students of SDU university on IOS(combination of PMS and Moodle)

## Problem Description

Students of SDU sometimes waste time when using both the Moodle and PMS. In the period of registration, they cannot access PMS for approximately 2-3 days. During the semester some teachers graded them in portal others in Moodle. It is a little bit problematic to see  grades on 2 different platforms.

## Methodology

Using Scrum methodology for creating a platform. We choose this method because it is convenient to small team to work in small tasks from one sprint to next sprint and to have transparency when working with clients and the developers team.

## Project Scope

Develop the LMS platform for students of SDU university on IOS. The project will be a combination of the current LMS and PMS platforms that are used and will include the most useful features as well as have other less useful features skipped. 
Key functionalities are: attendance page, teachers/students page, profile page, courses page, course registration page and so on. We think  pages of accounting info, questionnaires, gate entry requests example of pages that we do not need.
Key stakeholders are students and teachers. The key activities include and not limited to: research the needs of the stakeholders, the disadvantages of the currently used educational platforms, decide for which platforms (Android, IOS) to implement the solution, and build the platform. Project deliverable will be the MVP of a platform that will be used in educational purposes. The completion of the project will take approximately 2 to 3 months. No project constraints, as of now, are expected.

## Solution Application Areas
